  <h2>why are people homeless</h2>
  <p>people can be homeless due to houses being too expensive or being kicked out of a rental due to not being able to pay.</p>
  <p>people can be homeless due to family brecking up like the wife or husband getting the house other the other causing them to have to live on the streets or at a friends house</p>
  <p>children canbe homeless due to being kicked out or disowned with this there are many organisations to help children in these circumstances like youth off the streets
   

<h2>How do i think we can stop homelessness</h2> 
<p> the government could buy land to make shelters and provide a fund for homelessness which will only get them off the streets and money to buy food but it is a start. more that can happen is that the government forces business to stop raising the cost of stuff past a certain point</p>
